            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>I'm glad you could make it. You can learn a lot about my hobbies and professional background here. Since Windows 95, I've been interested in 
			computers, and I constantly try to keep up to date and upgrade with every new window. I was raised in Puerto Rico, where I was born.  have been 
			working only in the optical industry and have lived in Ohio for about 13 years. I have been employed in the optical industry for nearly 13 years, 
			and during that time I have gained specialized knowledge about the operation of optical vision from each manufacturer, including VSPOne, Hoya Vison, 
			|ExilorLuxxotica, and now Zenni Optical.Â I work at Zenni as a Production Optical Technician III, performing a variety of responsibilities. I have a 
			strong sense of competition and have shown it in both my work and video games. I participated in League of Legends @ Puerto Rico, one of the biggest 
			E-Sports games in the world, with the goal of competing against all Latin Americans. However, we finished in third place, so we were unable to advance. 
			My love for video games has never faded, and I've never let my fierce competitiveness deter me from going after my goals in life. My other interests include 
			baking and cooking meals. As far as music tastes go, I love all kinds of music.</p>
